# PingPong

This is a basic implementation of the Atari Pong game, but it's missing a few things intentionally and they're left as further exploration for the reader.
## Further Exploration
### Score
When a ball goes past a paddle, the other player should score a point. After every frame score is updated for both the player.
### Ball trajectory
The ball should change trajectory based on where it hit the paddle. For example, if it hit the topmost part of the paddle it should have a sharp angle upward, whereas if it hit the direct middle of the paddle it should move completely flat towards the other payer.
